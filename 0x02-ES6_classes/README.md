# JavaScript Classes, Promises, and Asynchronous Programming: A Complete Guide

## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile language that supports both object-oriented and asynchronous programming paradigms. This guide covers essential topics related to:
- Defining and working with Classes
- Adding methods and static methods to Classes
- Using Promises for handling asynchronous operations
- Managing errors with `throw`/`try...catch`
- Leveraging `async` functions and the `await` operator
- Metaprogramming using Symbols and Proxies

## Classes in JavaScript

### How to Define a Class

In JavaScript, classes are defined using the `class` keyword. The class structure includes a constructor and methods to define the behavior of objects.

```javascript
class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
    }
}
